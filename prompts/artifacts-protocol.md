# Artifacts Protocol Philosophy

## Core Principles

**Structured Intelligence**: Every analysis must produce systematic, traceable, and reviewable artifacts that build institutional knowledge.

**Multi-Agent Coordination**: Specialized analysts work independently but must integrate findings through standardized communication protocols.

**Quality Assurance**: All outputs require validation, cross-referencing, and confidence scoring before client presentation.

**Actionable Synthesis**: Raw analysis must be transformed into business-ready recommendations with clear ROI estimates and implementation timelines.

## Workflow Philosophy

1. **Deploy Specialists**: Coordinate domain experts for parallel analysis
2. **Standardize Outputs**: Ensure consistent structure and quality across all analysts
3. **Synthesize Intelligence**: Integrate findings into unified business narrative
4. **Validate & Review**: Manager approval ensures accuracy and strategic alignment
5. **Client-Ready Delivery**: Transform analysis into actionable sales intelligence

## File Organization Standards

**Session-Based Storage**: All artifacts must be stored in session-specific directories to maintain analysis traceability.

**Naming Convention**: `{artifact_type}_{restaurant_id}_{YYYYMMDD}.md`
- Analysis reports: `revenue_analysis_{RESTAURANT_ID}_{YYYYMMDD}.md`
- Synthesis documents: `synthesis_working_{RESTAURANT_ID}_{YYYYMMDD}.md`
- Final briefings: `sales_briefing_{RESTAURANT_ID}_{YYYYMMDD}.md`

**Session Context**: Read Session Context to determine correct `artifacts_directory` path.

## Quality Standards

- **Confidence Levels**: All metrics and recommendations must include confidence scoring
- **Source Documentation**: Clear traceability to data sources and assumptions
- **ROI Validation**: Financial projections require supporting calculations
- **Cross-Functional Integration**: Findings must connect across analytical domains
- **Manager Approval**: Final outputs require validation before client presentation

## Output Philosophy

Transform complex data analysis into clear business intelligence that drives partnership decisions and revenue growth. Every artifact should answer: "What should we do differently tomorrow?"
