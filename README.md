# Swiggy Dineout Challenge - Restaurant Performance Analysis System

An AI-powered co-pilot that generates sales intelligence briefings for restaurant partners by analyzing performance data across multiple dimensions (revenue, campaigns, operations, risk, and competitive positioning).

## Overview

This system addresses the real challenge faced by Sales Executives and Account Managers who manually gather performance metrics across multiple dashboards (taking 30mins to 3 hours per restaurant). Our GenAI Co-Pilot automates this process, generating structured, contextual performance summaries tailored for each restaurant partner.

### Problem Solved
- **Current Pain**: Manual data gathering from multiple dashboards before restaurant meetings
- **Solution**: Automated AI-powered briefings with actionable insights
- **Impact**: Save 30min-3hrs per restaurant analysis while improving insight quality

## Quick Start

### Generate Mode - Sales Intelligence Briefings

Generate comprehensive performance analysis and improvement recommendations:

```bash
# Generate briefing for restaurant R001
python main.py generate R001

# Use custom artifacts directory
python main.py generate R001 --artifacts-dir ./custom_artifacts

# Use specific session ID for tracking
python main.py generate R001 --session-id custom123

# Skip session initialization (not recommended)
python main.py generate R001 --no-session
```

### Evaluate Mode - Quality Assessment

Evaluate existing session results against PRD criteria and scoring rubrics:

```bash
# Evaluate a specific session's output quality
python main.py evaluate --session-id abc123def456
```

## System Architecture
