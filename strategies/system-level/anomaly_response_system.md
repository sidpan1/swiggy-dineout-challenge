# Anomaly Response System

## Purpose

This is our early warning and rapid response system. Instead of waiting for scheduled reviews, I want to catch problems as they happen and intervene before they become crises.

## Real-Time Monitoring Triggers

Check these patterns every 2 hours between 10 AM and 10 PM:

### Critical Anomalies (Respond within 2 hours)

1. **Revenue Cliff**
   - Today's revenue < 50% of 7-day average
   - Zero bookings during usual peak hours (12-2 PM, 7-9 PM)
   - Action: Call restaurant immediately, check if they're operational

2. **Mass Cancellation Event**
   - Cancellation rate > 50% in last 4 hours
   - 5+ cancellations with similar reasons
   - Action: Investigate operational issues, bad reviews, or competitor actions

3. **Ad Campaign Failure**
   - Ad spend >₹500 with zero conversions
   - CTR drops below 0.5% suddenly
   - Action: Pause campaign, review targeting, check landing page

### High Priority Anomalies (Respond within 24 hours)

1. **Occupancy Vacuum**
   - Occupancy 3 standard deviations below normal
   - Empty during typically busy periods
   - Pattern: Check weather, local events, construction

2. **Rating Crash**
   - Rating drops 0.5+ points in 3 days
   - Multiple 1-2 star reviews mentioning same issue
   - Action: Read all recent reviews, compile issues, schedule visit

3. **Competitive Disruption**
   - 30%+ traffic loss to specific competitor
   - New restaurant opening impact
   - Action: Competitive response plan, differentiation strategy

## Learning Loop

Every anomaly teaches us something:

   - Which intervention worked?

2. **Refine Detection**
   - Was it a false positive?
   - Should thresholds be adjusted?
   - New patterns to monitor?

3. **Update Playbooks**
   - What worked better than expected?
