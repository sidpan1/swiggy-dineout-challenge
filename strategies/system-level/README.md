# System-Level Strategies

These strategies provide proactive monitoring and response capabilities across the entire restaurant portfolio, independent of individual restaurant classifications.

## Available Strategies

### 🚨 Anomaly Response System (anomaly_response_system.md)
- **Purpose**: Early warning and rapid intervention
- **Monitors**: Statistical anomalies, business rule violations, contextual issues
- **Response Time**: 2 hours (critical) to 48 hours (medium)
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time pattern detection
  - Severity-based escalation
  - Contextual intelligence
  - Learning loop for improvement

### 🛡️ Competitive Response Protocol (competitive_response_protocol.md)
- **Purpose**: Protect against competitive threats
- **Monitors**: Market share shifts, partner vulnerability, competitor moves
- **Response Time**: 6 hours (war room) to 1 week (monitoring)
- **Key Features**:
  - Intelligence gathering
  - Response strategy matrix
  - Win-back protocols
  - Long-term moat building

### 📅 Seasonal Pattern Optimizer (seasonal_pattern_optimizer.md)
- **Purpose**: Leverage predictable seasonal patterns
- **Monitors**: Restaurants with >50% seasonal variance
- **Response Time**: Monthly planning cycles
- **Key Features**:
  - Peak maximization
  - Valley mitigation
  - Annual planning
  - Alternative revenue streams

## Best Practices

1. **Don't Cry Wolf**: Calibrate thresholds to avoid alert fatigue
2. **Context Matters**: Consider seasonality, events, weather
3. **Learn and Adapt**: Every incident improves the system
4. **Coordinate Responses**: Ensure interventions don't conflict
5. **Document Everything**: Build institutional knowledge
