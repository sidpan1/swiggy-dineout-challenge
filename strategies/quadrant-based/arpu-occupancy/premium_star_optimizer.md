# Premium Star Restaurant Optimizer

## Strategic Context

This strategy is for restaurants classified as "Premium Stars" - those with both high ARPU (>₹800) and high occupancy (>70%). These are our best performers, but they still have untapped potential for revenue maximization.

## When to Activate

Monitor these conditions daily at 10 AM:
- Restaurant is classified as Premium Star (high ARPU + high occupancy)
- It's a weekday (Monday to Thursday)
- Ad spend efficiency has dropped below 3.5x ROI in the last 7 days
- Average rating remains above 4.2

## My Strategy

Since these restaurants are already performing well, I want to focus on maximizing their revenue per customer and maintaining their premium positioning:

1. **Premium Experience Enhancement**
   - Introduce a "Chef's Special Tasting Menu" at 20% premium pricing
   - Limited availability: only 20 tables per day
   - Push this to high-value customers who've spent >₹1000 per visit before
   - Create FOMO with "exclusive for Swiggy Dineout members" messaging

2. **Smart Ad Optimization**
   - Reduce broad targeting by 30% (they're already popular)
   - Shift budget to lookalike audiences of their best customers
   - Target corporate accounts for weekday business lunches
   - Focus on 5-star hotels and premium residential areas within 5km

3. **Strategic Notification Campaign**
   - Don't spam everyone - quality over quantity
   - Send personalized messages to top 20% customers: "Your favorite table at [Restaurant] awaits"
   - Highlight wine pairings, seasonal ingredients, chef's story
   - Time notifications for 4 PM (dinner decision time)

## Success Metrics

- Maintain occupancy above 70% while increasing ARPU by 10%
- Achieve 4x+ ROI on refined ad targeting
- 30% take-rate on premium tasting menu
- No decline in average rating

## Risk Management

- If occupancy drops below 65%, immediately revert to broader targeting
- Monitor competitor movements - if a new premium restaurant opens nearby, increase defensive spending
- Cap premium menu at 30% of total capacity to maintain exclusivity
- Track rating daily - any drop below 4.2 triggers review of experience

## Long-term Vision

These restaurants are our flagship partners. The goal isn't just revenue today, but building a sustainable premium positioning that allows them to weather competition and maintain pricing power. Every interaction should reinforce their premium status while driving incremental high-value traffic.
