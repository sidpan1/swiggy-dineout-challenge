# Volume Play Scaling Strategy

## Restaurant Profile

Volume Plays are interesting - they have high occupancy (>70%) but low ARPU (<₹500). These are typically:
- Quick service restaurants
- Casual dining with competitive pricing  
- Great food but leaving money on the table
- Popular with students, young professionals

## Opportunity

These restaurants have cracked the footfall formula but need help with monetization. My goal is to increase their ARPU without losing their volume advantage.

## Activation Criteria

Review daily at 11 AM:
- Restaurant consistently in Volume Play quadrant (high occupancy, low ARPU)
- Occupancy stable above 70% for last 14 days
- Rating above 4.0 (quality isn't the issue)
- Current ARPU between ₹350-500
- Peak hour wait times exist (demand > supply signal)

## Revenue Scaling Strategy

I'll implement a careful approach to increase revenue per customer without damaging their volume business:

1. **Smart Upselling Implementation**
   - Introduce "Make it a Combo" options with 15-20% savings
   - Dessert recommendations at 30% off when ordered with mains
   - Beverage pairing suggestions (highest margin items)
   - "Family feast" bundles for groups - better value, higher ticket

2. **Premium Hour Pricing**
   - Implement 10-15% surge pricing during peak hours (Friday/Saturday 7-10 PM)
   - Position as "Priority Seating" - pay slightly more, skip the wait
   - Use dynamic pricing based on real-time occupancy
   - Clearly communicate value - "Beat the wait time"

3. **Add-on Services Revenue**
   - Introduce "Birthday Special" packages at ₹199 extra
   - Sell "Date Night" ambiance upgrade - special table, complimentary dessert
   - Corporate lunch packages with guaranteed 30-min service
   - Advance table booking fee (₹50) for prime slots

4. **Loyalty Program Monetization**
   - Create paid membership tier at ₹99/month
   - Benefits: 10% off always, priority booking, exclusive menu items
   - Target regular customers (visiting 4+ times monthly)
   - Gamify with points, badges, social sharing

## Channel Optimization

Different strategies for different booking sources:

1. **Direct Swiggy App Users**
   - Show combo deals prominently
   - Pre-order options for faster service
   - Group ordering features

2. **Walk-in Conversions**
   - QR code for app download with ₹100 off first booking
   - Capture data for retargeting
   - Exclusive app-only dishes

3. **Corporate Accounts**
   - B2B packages for team lunches
   - Monthly billing options
   - Dedicated account manager for 10+ person bookings

## Testing & Measurement

Week 1-2: Soft launch
- Test combo upsells with 20% of customers
- A/B test pricing on different days
- Measure impact on satisfaction

Week 3-4: Scale winners
- Roll out successful initiatives to all customers
- Fine-tune based on feedback
- Monitor occupancy closely

Month 2: Full implementation
- All strategies live
- Target: 20% ARPU increase
- Maintain 70%+ occupancy

## Risk Mitigation

Watch for these warning signs:
- Occupancy drops below 65% → Roll back price changes
- Rating falls below 4.0 → Review customer feedback
- Negative social media → Adjust messaging
- Competitor responds → Prepare counter-offers

## Success Metrics

30-day targets:
- ARPU increase: ₹350 → ₹425+ (20%+)
- Occupancy maintained: 70%+ 
- Rating stable: 4.0+
- Upsell acceptance: 30%+ take combos
- Premium slot revenue: 15% of total

60-day vision:
- Graduate to "Hidden Gems" or approach "Premium Stars"
- ARPU crosses ₹500
- Sustainable premium offerings
- Restaurant invests in ambiance/service upgrades

## Key Insight

Volume Plays have already won customer trust and footfall. Our job is to help them monetize this asset without breaking what made them successful. Every intervention should feel like added value, not a price hike. The mantra: "Same great food, more ways to enjoy it!"
