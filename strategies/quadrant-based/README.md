# Quadrant-Based Strategies

This folder contains strategies organized by two distinct classification frameworks, each with its own philosophy and approach:

## 📊 Two Classification Philosophies

### 1. Performance-Potential Matrix (`/performance-potential`)
- **Philosophy**: Future-oriented growth potential assessment
- **Focus**: Where restaurants can go based on market conditions
- **Best For**: Strategic planning, investment decisions, long-term growth

### 2. ARPU-Occupancy Matrix (`/arpu-occupancy`)
- **Philosophy**: Current business metrics optimization
- **Focus**: Immediate revenue and efficiency improvements
- **Best For**: Monthly operations, quick wins, revenue optimization

## 🎯 Choosing the Right Framework

| Use Performance-Potential When | Use ARPU-Occupancy When |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Planning quarterly strategies | Need immediate revenue impact |
| Evaluating growth investments | Optimizing current operations |
| Market expansion decisions | Monthly performance reviews |
| Long-term positioning | Tactical interventions |

## 🔄 Combined Usage

For maximum impact, use both frameworks:

1. **Start with ARPU-Occupancy** for immediate improvements
2. **Layer Performance-Potential** for strategic direction
3. **Cross-reference** to validate strategic decisions

Example: A restaurant might be a "Volume Play" (high occupancy, low ARPU) in the current state but identified as a "Hidden Gem" (high potential) for premium positioning.
