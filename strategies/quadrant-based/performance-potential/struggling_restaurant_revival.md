# Struggling Restaurant Revival Plan

## Problem We're Solving

This strategy targets restaurants in the "Strugglers" quadrant - low ARPU (<₹500) and low occupancy (<40%). These partners need immediate intervention to prevent churn and help them recover to sustainable levels.

## Activation Triggers

Run this check every morning at 9 AM:
- Restaurant has been in Strugglers quadrant for 7+ days
- Bookings have declined >20% week-over-week
- Cancellation rate exceeds 25%
- Ad ROI is below 1.5x (if they're running ads)
- Account manager hasn't visited in the last 14 days

## Recovery Strategy

I need a multi-pronged approach to revive these restaurants without burning too much money:

1. **Aggressive Visibility Boost**
   - Offer 3-day FREE ad credits worth ₹1000 to kickstart visibility
   - Ensure they appear in top 5 results for their cuisine/locality
   - Add "NEW OFFERS" badge to their listing
   - Feature in "Hidden Gems" or "Great Deals" collections

2. **Smart Discounting Strategy**
   - Start with 30% off on all orders for first 3 days (funded by Swiggy)
   - Then transition to 20% restaurant-funded discount
   - Create bundle deals: "Meal for 2 at ₹399" to improve perceived value
   - Weekend special: Kids eat free (drives family traffic)

3. **Operational Interventions**
   - Send account manager for on-site visit within 48 hours
   - Review and optimize menu - remove poor sellers, highlight bestsellers
   - Improve photos - offer free photography session if needed
   - Check basics: accurate hours, phone responsiveness, description

4. **Targeted Customer Win-back**
   - Identify past customers who haven't returned in 30 days
   - Send personalized "We miss you" messages with 25% off
   - Share what's new: "New chef", "Renovated ambiance", "Improved service"

## Anomaly Detection & Response

If I detect these patterns, escalate immediately:
- Zero bookings for 2 consecutive days → Call restaurant, check operations
- Mass cancellations (>50%) → Possible operational issue, send field visit
- Sudden rating drop → Review recent feedback, address immediately

## Success Milestones

Week 1: Stop the bleeding
- Occupancy increases to 25%+
- Bookings stop declining

Week 2-3: Build momentum
- Reach 35% occupancy
- ARPU improves by 15%
- Positive reviews start coming

Week 4: Graduate from Strugglers
- Stable at 40%+ occupancy
- ARPU crosses ₹550
- Restaurant commits to continued improvement

## Investment & Returns

Total intervention cost: ₹5000-8000 per restaurant
- Ad credits: ₹1000
- Swiggy-funded discounts: ₹3000
- Photography/support: ₹1000-4000

Expected return: 
- Prevent churn (saves ₹50,000+ in acquisition cost)
- Restaurant reaches break-even within 30 days
- Long-term partnership value: ₹2-3 lakhs annually

## Graduation Criteria

Move them out of crisis mode when:
- Consistent 40%+ occupancy for 7 days
- ARPU improvement trend for 2 weeks
- Owner engagement is high
- They're willing to invest in their own growth

After graduation, transition them to either "Volume Plays" or "Hidden Gems" strategy based on their strengths.
