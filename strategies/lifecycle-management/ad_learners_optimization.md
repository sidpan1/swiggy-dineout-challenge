# Ad Learners Optimization Journey

## Understanding Ad Learners

Ad Learners are restaurants showing improving ROI trends but haven't yet mastered advertising. They're willing to invest but need guidance to unlock full potential. Currently getting 1.5-2.5x ROI when champions get 3-4x.

## Identification Markers

Weekly scan on Wednesdays:
- Currently spending on ads but sub-optimal ROI (<2.5x)
- Showing improvement trend (ROI increasing MoM)
- Willing to experiment and invest
- Good core product (rating >4.0)
- Underperforming vs. similar restaurants

## Education & Optimization Strategy

Transform Ad Learners into Ad Champions through systematic improvement:

1. **Diagnostic Deep Dive**
   - Analyze current campaign performance:
     - Which creatives work/don't work?
     - Time-of-day performance
     - Audience segment response
     - Day-of-week patterns
   - Compare with Ad Champions in same category
   - Identify top 3 improvement opportunities
   - Create benchmark targets

2. **Creative Optimization Sprint**
   - Most Ad Learners use generic creatives
   - Test variations:
     - Food photography vs. ambiance shots
     - Discount messaging vs. quality messaging
     - Urgency ("Tonight only") vs. planning ("Book for weekend")
   - A/B test rigorously:
     - Run 2-week sprints
     - Minimum 1000 impressions per variant
     - Statistical significance required

3. **Audience Refinement Workshop**
   - Move from broad to precise targeting:
     - Start: "People in Koramangala"
     - Refine: "25-35 professionals who ordered Italian last month"
     - Perfect: "High-spenders who book 2 days in advance for weekend dinners"
   - Lookalike audiences from best customers
   - Exclude poor-fit segments (identified from data)
   - Geo-fence competitors intelligently

4. **Timing & Pacing Mastery**
   - When to advertise matters as much as what:
     - Lunch restaurants: 10-11 AM push
     - Dinner focus: 4-6 PM prime time
     - Weekend warriors: Thursday-Friday blitz
   - Budget pacing strategies:
     - Don't blow budget by noon
     - Reserve 40% for peak conversion hours
     - Day-parting based on their patterns
