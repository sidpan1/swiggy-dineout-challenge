# Rising Stars Acceleration Program

## Catching Momentum

Rising Stars are restaurants showing consistent growth >20% MoM. They're on fire, and our job is to pour fuel on that fire while ensuring they don't burn out.

## Identification Signals

## Acceleration Strategy

When momentum is building, double down aggressively:

1. **Ride the Wave**

   - Boost ad spend by 50% while ROI is high
   - Feature in "Trending Now" sections
   - Push notifications: "Everyone's talking about [Restaurant]"
   - Create FOMO: "Booked 127 times today"

2. **Capacity Readiness**
   - Momentum can break operations if not prepared
   - Daily check-ins during acceleration phase
   - Help them staff up BEFORE they're overwhelmed
