# Lunch Rush Optimizer

## Strategy Intent

When we're approaching the lunch rush period (11:30 AM to 2:00 PM on weekdays) and our restaurant occupancy is below 80%, I want to quickly attract more diners to maximize our lunch revenue.

## What I Want to Happen

1. **Offer an attractive discount**: Create a 25% discount on all lunch combo meals and lunch specials. This should be valid only during the lunch window and limited to one use per customer.

2. **Boost our visibility**: Increase our advertising spend on food delivery platforms (Swiggy, Zomato) by 50% for the next 2 hours. Focus on users within a 3km radius who have ordered lunch from similar restaurants before.

3. **Alert nearby customers**: Send push notifications to all app users within a 2km radius who have our app installed. The message should be friendly and mention the limited-time lunch deal.

## Success Looks Like

- Restaurant reaches 85% occupancy by 12:30 PM
- Average order value remains above â‚¹350 despite the discount
- At least 50 orders use the discount code

## Safety Measures

- If we hit 95% occupancy, immediately reduce the discount to 15% to avoid overwhelming the kitchen
- Cap total discount redemptions at 200 to protect margins
- Don't run this strategy more than 3 times per week

## Additional Context

Our kitchen can handle up to 150 orders per hour during peak times. The lunch menu has good margins even with a 25% discount. Previous lunch promotions have shown that customers who try our lunch specials have a 40% chance of becoming repeat dinner customers.
