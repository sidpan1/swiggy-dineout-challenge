# Happy Hour Promotion

## Objective

Boost weekday evening traffic (4:00 PM - 7:00 PM) when we typically see a lull between lunch and dinner service. I want to attract office workers and early diners with compelling offers.

## Strategy Description

During the quiet afternoon-to-evening transition, when occupancy drops below 40%, activate a multi-channel campaign to drive traffic:

1. **Special pricing on beverages**: Offer 30% off all beverages (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and appetizers. Create a "Happy Hour Menu" featuring quick bites that pair well with drinks.

2. **Target office workers**: Send targeted notifications to users who work within 1km (based on their lunch ordering patterns). Message should emphasize "unwind after work" and mention the limited timing.

3. **Social media blast**: Post eye-catching content on Instagram and Facebook showcasing our ambiance and happy hour offerings. Boost these posts with ₹500 budget targeting local professionals aged 25-45.

## Trigger Conditions

- Time: Monday to Friday, evaluate at 3:45 PM
- Occupancy: Less than 40% current capacity
- Weather: Not raining heavily (people are more likely to stop by)
- Not a public holiday

## Expected Outcomes

- Increase occupancy to 60%+ by 5:30 PM
- Generate ₹15,000+ in beverage revenue
- Create a relaxed atmosphere that encourages longer stays and dinner orders

## Constraints and Rollback

- Maximum 2 hours duration for the promotion
- If occupancy exceeds 80%, end the beverage discount but keep appetizer discount
- Budget cap of ₹2000 per day for all promotional activities
- Don't run if a private event is booked for the evening

## Notes

Happy hour customers often stay for dinner if they're having a good time. Ensure service staff are briefed to provide exceptional service and suggest dinner options as the promotion ends. Track how many happy hour customers convert to dinner orders.
