# Agentic Platform Documentation

## Overview

This folder contains the foundational documentation for building an **Agentic Platform** - an intelligent automation system that uses AI agents to execute business workflows written in natural language. Rather than traditional coded automation, this platform enables business processes to be expressed as SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) that are intelligently executed by AI agents.

## The Vision

Most organizations today juggle four fragmented automation approaches: coded logic, ML models, documentation/SOPs, and now AI agents. This creates integration complexity, context loss, and change management nightmares. The Agentic Platform unifies these into a single system where business processes are written in natural language and compiled to code when deterministic execution is needed.

## Document Guide

### üìã [Automation Platform Concept](./automation-platform-concept.md)
**Start here for the business case and conceptual understanding.**

- **What**: The problems with current automation approaches and the solution vision
- **Why**: Business benefits and user stories for different personas  
- **Who**: User personas (Business Owners, Process Analysts, Technical Experts)
- **Success Metrics**: Platform adoption and business impact targets

### üèóÔ∏è [Technical Architecture](./technical-architecture.md)
**Deep dive into implementation details and system design.**

- **How**: Technical components and service architecture
- **What**: Agent SDK, workflow definitions, and platform services
- **Architecture**: Three-layer system (Workflows ‚Üí Platform ‚Üí Systems)
- **Meta-Intelligence**: Self-improving feedback loops and recursive optimization

## Key Concepts

- **Agentic Workflows**: Individual business processes executed by AI agents
- **Agentic Platform**: Infrastructure and runtime environment for workflow execution
- **Agentic Systems**: Complete intelligent organization with self-improving capabilities
- **Meta-Intelligence**: Using AI to optimize AI workflows recursively
- **Autonomy Levels**: L1 (Task execution) ‚Üí L2 (Workflow execution) ‚Üí L3 (Job role execution)

## Visual Framework

The platform operates on a **recursive self-improvement cycle** where meta-workflows continuously analyze and optimize core business workflows, creating exponential capability growth rather than linear efficiency gains.
