# System Architecture: Claude Code as a New Computing Primitive

## The Problem: Sales Intelligence at Scale

Swiggy Dineout Sales Executives spend **30 minutes to 3 hours** manually gathering restaurant performance data before each partner meeting. With hundreds of partners per city, this approach doesn't scale.

**Required Analysis**: OPD (Orders Per Day), Revenue/GOV, Ads ROI across "bookings, ad performance, campaign ROI, peer comparisons, and discount effectiveness"

**Solution**: Reduce to **<30 seconds** automated analysis using Claude Code as an orchestration primitive.

## Claude Code: A New Computing Primitive

This project demonstrates **Claude Code as a new primitive for business process automation**—where complex multi-step workflows are expressed in natural language and executed by an AI agent with full tool access.

### Traditional Computing Primitives
- **Functions**: Reusable code blocks
- **Classes**: Object-oriented abstractions  
- **APIs**: Service interfaces
- **Databases**: Data persistence

### Claude Code as Primitive
- **Natural Language Workflows**: Business logic expressed as markdown prompts
- **Agentic Execution**: AI agent with database access, file operations, session management
- **Tool Integration**: Direct terminal access for real operations
- **Context Awareness**: Full project understanding across multiple files and data sources

## How Claude Code Enables This Architecture

### Single Command Orchestration
```bash
python generate_recommendations.py R001
# Executes: claude -p "Generate improvement recommendations for restaurant R001" 
#          --system-prompt "$(cat prompts/*.md)" --output-format stream-json
```

**What Actually Happens**:
1. **Session Management**: Creates unique session ID, artifact directories
2. **Prompt Compilation**: Loads business logic from markdown files  
3. **Claude Code Execution**: AI agent executes multi-step workflow
4. **Tool Integration**: Database queries, file operations, structured output

### Claude Code's Unique Capabilities in This Project

#### 1. Natural Language Business Logic
Instead of writing Python functions for analysis, the entire workflow is defined in markdown:

```markdown
# Senior Sales Manager - Multi-Agent Orchestration System
Deploy specialized data analysts in PARALLEL:
- Revenue Optimization Analyst: Capacity utilization, pricing efficiency
- Campaign Performance Analyst: ROI analysis, marketing effectiveness  
- Competitive Intelligence Analyst: Market positioning, peer benchmarking
```

#### 2. Agentic Database Operations
Claude Code directly queries SQLite database based on natural language instructions:

```markdown
# Data Sources
Use sqlite bash tool to query the database:
sqlite3 {db_url_from_session} "SELECT campaign_id, spend, revenue_generated 
FROM ads_data WHERE restaurant_id = 'R001';"
```

#### 3. Multi-File Orchestration
Claude Code maintains context across all prompt files and generates coordinated analysis:
- Reads session context from `initialize_session.py`
- Loads business logic from 9 prompt files
- Executes database queries based on `data-sources.md`
- Generates structured artifacts per `artifacts-protocol.md`

#### 4. Real File Operations
Claude Code creates actual analysis artifacts:
```
.artifacts/2957a1b9/
├── improvement_recommendations_R001_20250622.md
├── campaign_performance_analysis_R001_20250622.md  
├── competitive_intelligence_analysis_R001_20250622.md
└── [5 more specialized analysis files]
```

## Why Claude Code is a "New Primitive"

### Traditional Development vs Claude Code

#### Traditional Approach (What This Would Require)
```python
class CampaignAnalyst:
    def analyze_roi(self, restaurant_id):
        # 50+ lines of SQL queries, data processing, calculations
        
class RevenueAnalyst:
    def analyze_capacity(self, restaurant_id):
        # 100+ lines of operational metrics processing
        
class SalesIntelligenceOrchestrator:
    def generate_briefing(self, restaurant_id):
        # 200+ lines orchestrating analysts, formatting output
        
# Total: ~500+ lines of Python code to maintain
```

#### Claude Code Approach (What We Actually Built)
```bash
# Business logic in natural language (9 markdown files)
# Execution in single command:
claude -p "Generate improvement recommendations for restaurant R001" 
      --system-prompt "$(cat prompts/*.md)"
```

**Result**: Business stakeholders can modify analysis logic by editing markdown files, no Python programming required.

### The Primitive Breakthrough

**Traditional Primitives** require technical expertise:
- **Functions**: Need programming knowledge
- **APIs**: Need interface design
- **Databases**: Need schema design

**Claude Code Primitive** is business-stakeholder accessible:
- **Natural Language Workflows**: Domain experts can read and modify
- **Tool Integration**: Database access, file operations happen automatically  
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains state across complex multi-step processes

### Real Evidence of the Primitive in Action

**Input**: Single restaurant ID (`R001`)
**Processing**: Claude Code executes natural language workflow across 12 database tables
**Output**: Sales Executive gets immediately usable intelligence:

- "Increase ad spend by ₹5,000/month → ₹44,150 additional monthly revenue"
- "Focus on 12 PM, 4-6 PM, 10-11 PM slots for capacity optimization"  
- "Rating volatility (3.6-4.3) requires operational excellence program"

**Key Innovation**: The entire business process is **readable and modifiable by Sales Managers** who understand restaurant operations but don't write code.

## Technical Architecture: Claude Code + Structured Data

### Challenge Requirements vs Implementation

**Basic Challenge**: 3 tables (restaurant_metrics, ads_data, peer_benchmarks)
**Our Implementation**: 12-table business intelligence platform

**Why?** Claude Code enables complex analysis workflows, so we built comprehensive data architecture to generate **actionable sales intelligence** rather than basic reports.

### Claude Code's Database Integration

Claude Code executes SQL queries based on natural language instructions in `data-sources.md`:

```markdown
# Query restaurant performance metrics
sqlite3 {db_url_from_session} "SELECT restaurant_id, date, bookings, revenue 
FROM restaurant_metrics WHERE restaurant_id = 'R001' ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Analyze campaign ROI  
sqlite3 {db_url_from_session} "SELECT campaign_id, spend, revenue_generated,
(revenue_generated/spend) as roi FROM ads_data WHERE restaurant_id = 'R001';"
```

**Result**: Claude Code automatically queries the right tables based on analysis requirements, no hard-coded SQL in Python.

## Claude Code Execution Model

### The Critical Command
```bash
# generate_recommendations.py line 184-191:
cmd = [
    "claude",
    "-p", "Generate improvement recommendations for restaurant R001",
    "--output-format", "stream-json",
    "--verbose", 
    "--dangerously-skip-permissions",
    "--system-prompt", enhanced_system_prompt  # All 9 markdown files combined
]
```

### What Makes This a "Primitive"

**1. Natural Language System Prompts**
Instead of coded business logic, the entire workflow is defined in markdown that business stakeholders can read and modify:

```markdown
# orchestration.md
You are a Senior Sales Manager for Swiggy Dineout, responsible for 
orchestrating a team of specialized data analysts to generate 
comprehensive sales intelligence briefings.

Deploy specialized data analysts in PARALLEL:
- Revenue Optimization Analyst: Capacity utilization, pricing efficiency
- Campaign Performance Analyst: ROI analysis, marketing effectiveness
- Competitive Intelligence Analyst: Market positioning, peer benchmarking
```

**2. Agentic Tool Integration**
Claude Code automatically:
- Reads session context from `initialize_session.py` 
- Queries SQLite database based on instructions in `data-sources.md`
- Creates structured artifacts per `artifacts-protocol.md`
- Maintains context across multi-step analysis

**3. Real Business Value**
Output is immediately usable by Sales Executives:
- "Spice Garden shows 8.83x ROI vs 3.2x peer benchmark"
- "Increase ad spend by ₹5,000/month for ₹44,150 additional revenue"
- "Rating volatility (3.6-4.3) requires operational excellence program"

**Time Saved**: 30 minutes to 3 hours → 30 seconds
