**Date**: January 21, 2025  
**Version**: 2.0  
**Status**: Draft  
**Focus**: Sales Executive & Restaurant Partner Personas

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The Agentic Workflow Platform is a revolutionary system that enables business processes to be written in natural language and executed by AI agents.
