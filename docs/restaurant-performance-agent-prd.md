# Product Requirements Document: Restaurant Performance Co-Pilot Agent

## 1. Product Overview

### Agent Identity & Purpose
- **Agent Name**: Restaurant Performance Co-Pilot
- **Primary Function**: Automatically generates structured, contextual performance summaries for restaurant partners based on restaurant_id input to enable data-driven sales conversations
- **Target Users**: Sales Executives and Account Managers managing restaurant partnerships at Swiggy Dineout
- **Business Value**: Reduces manual data gathering time from 30 minutes-3 hours to <30 seconds per restaurant, enabling scalable partner management across hundreds of restaurants per city

### Agent Context & Mental Model
- **User's Mental Model**: Users expect this agent to function like a "smart research assistant" that instantly compiles the same insights they would manually gather from multiple dashboards, presented in a sales-ready format
- **Boundaries of Trust**: Agent outputs are treated as starting points for sales conversations, not absolute truth. Users expect 85%+ accuracy with clear confidence indicators for uncertain data points
- **Expectations of Control**: Users need ability to drill down into specific metrics, request additional analysis, and override/edit recommendations before sharing with restaurant partners

## 2. User Stories

- Generate at least 5 specific, ROI-quantified recommendations with implementation priority and effort estimates
- Detect and flag revenue anomalies, service quality degradation, or competitive threats within 24 hours of occurrence
- Provide capacity utilization insights identifying underperforming time slots and revenue recovery opportunities

### Should (Expected Behaviors)

- Surface competitive advantages and market positioning opportunities specific to locality and cuisine
- Suggest specific budget reallocation amounts based on campaign performance gaps vs benchmarks

### Must Not (Safety Rails)
- Fabricate operational data or financial metrics when insufficient data exists
- Recommend budget increases >25% without flagging as "requires validation"
- Make partnership health assessments without incorporating both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback scores
- Suggest competitive strategies without sufficient local market intelligence
- Auto-trigger account escalations without clear risk threshold documentation
- Recommend operational changes affecting customer experience without service quality context
- Make revenue projections beyond current trend confidence intervals

### Edge Case Handling
- **Ambiguous Input**: "restaurant ABC" → "I need a specific restaurant_id (format R###) to generate an accurate performance summary. Could you provide the restaurant_id for ABC?"
- **Low Confidence**: Missing peer data → "⚠️ Limited peer data available for this locality/cuisine combination. Benchmarking confidence: Low. Consider expanding comparison to broader geographic area."
- **Error State**: Data unavailable → "Unable to generate complete summary due to missing campaign data for this period. Would you like me to create a partial summary with available metrics and flag data gaps for follow-up?"
